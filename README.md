Learning library project


this is a bit jank rn, but I don't fancy rewriting it a second time. Will come back to this later!

Lessons learned:
    -   CSS: less is more! Think carefully about classes and sub-classes. Assign colour variables. Organise CSS doc by section - e.g header, main, objects e.g buttons, modals
    -   javascript: functions functions functions! How can something be a function. Assign global variables for items already in the html. Think about naming conventions! Use objects and classes. Put stuff into arrays/libraries before displaying it on the page!
